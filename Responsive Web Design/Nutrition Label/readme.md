# Nutrition Label
A nutrition label is a standardized table found on packaged food and beverage products that provides detailed information about the nutritional content of the product. It typically includes information about serving size, calories, macronutrients (such as fat, carbohydrates, and protein), micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), and other important nutritional components like dietary fiber and sugars. Nutrition labels are regulated by governmental agencies in many countries to ensure consistency and accuracy in the information provided to consumers, helping them make informed choices about their dietary intake.<br>
