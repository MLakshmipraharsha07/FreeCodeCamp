# CSS Box Model: Building a Rothko Painting üñåÔ∏è

In this project, we recreate a painting by the renowned artist Mark Rothko using HTML and CSS. By leveraging the CSS box model, we can break down the painting into its constituent rectangles, each representing a color block in the original artwork. This project serves as a fun exercise to explore the CSS box model and its application in creating visually stunning compositions.<br>

## Rothko Painting

### Implementation
To build the Rothko painting using HTML and CSS, we divide the canvas into multiple colored rectangles, carefully adjusting their dimensions and positions to match the original artwork. By applying background colors and borders, we mimic the appearance of Rothko's iconic color fields, capturing the essence of his abstract expressionist style.<br>
